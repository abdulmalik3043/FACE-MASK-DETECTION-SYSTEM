# FACE-MASK-DETECTION-SYSTEM
This project named “Face Mask Detection System” can detect a person in real-time if he/she
is wearing a mask or not using CCTV camera with quite a good accuracy. After that, he/she is denied
access to places where authorities have strictly asked to wear the face mask. After denying access to
the person, authorities will get an alert email in real-time where the person’s photo will be attached. May be screen panels could be installed at the entrances where a person when denied can see a
pop-up Warning Message where he/she would be advised to wear a mask before getting access. This
project will be useful during the times of pandemic when people will be suggested to wear a mask
when going in public. Wearing a face mask is a new norm today when going in public. It is very
important to wear the mask to restrict the spread of virus
